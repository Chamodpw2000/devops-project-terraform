Terraform has several types of blocks that serve different purposes in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configuration.
Here are the main types of blocks in Terraform:

1. Resource Block : Define infrastructure components that Terraform should create, update, or delete.

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}


2. Data Source Blocks: Retrieve information about existing infrastructure or external data.
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]
}

3. Module Block: Call and configure reusable modules.

module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

4. Variable Blocks: Define input variables that make configurations flexible and reusable.

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

5. Output Blocks: Define the output values that should be displayed after the infrastructure is applied.

output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

6. Provider Blocks : Configure providers (cloud platforms, services) that Terraform uses.

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}


Terraform Remote Backend

In Terraform, a remote backend is a configuration that stores the Terraform state file remotely,
rather than locally on your machine. The state file (terraform.tfstate) keeps track of resources Terraform manages,
and is critical for collaboration and consistency.

Why Use a Remote Backend?

Collaboration: Multiple team members can work on the same infrastructure without conflicting state changes.
Security: State files may contain sensitive data; remote backends can offer encryption and access control.
Reliability: Remote storage is less likely to be lost or corrupted than a local file.

How It Works
When you configure a remote backend (such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Terraform Cloud), 
Terraform automatically stores and retrieves the state file from that location. It also locks the
state during operations to prevent concurrent changes.

Example: S3 Remote Backend

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

bucket: The S3 bucket name.
key: The path to the state file within the bucket.
region: AWS region for the bucket.

Benefits
State Locking: Prevents simultaneous changes.
Versioning: Some backends support versioning for rollback.
Centralized Management: Easier to manage infrastructure state.

State Locking

State locking in Terraform is a mechanism that prevents multiple users or processes from making concurrent changes to the same state file. This is important because simultaneous updates can corrupt the state and lead to inconsistent infrastructure.

How State Locking Works

When you run a Terraform operation (like apply or plan), Terraform tries to acquire a lock on the state file.
If the lock is acquired, other operations must wait until the lock is released.
If another process already holds the lock, Terraform will fail or wait (depending on the backend and configuration).

Why Is State Locking Important?

Prevents Race Conditions: Ensures only one operation modifies the state at a time.
Protects State Integrity: Avoids corruption and conflicting changes.
Enables Safe Collaboration: Multiple team members can work together without risk of overwriting each other's changes.

Which Backends Support State Locking?
Most remote backends (like AWS S3 with DynamoDB, Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob Storage) support state locking.
Local backend does not support locking.

Example: S3 Backend with DynamoDB Locking
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "state/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
  }
}

dynamodb_table: Used for state locking in AWS.


Modules in AWS

In AWS (using Terraform), a module is a reusable, self-contained package of Terraform configuration
that manages a specific set of resources. Modules help organize code, promote reuse, and simplify 
complex infrastructure setups.

Key Points:
Encapsulation: A module groups related resources (like VPC, EC2, security groups) into a single unit.
Reusability: You can use the same module in multiple places, passing different variables for customization.
Structure: A module usually contains main.tf (resources), variables.tf (inputs), and outputs.tf (outputs).

Suppose you have a VPC module:

module "vpc" {
  source    = "./modules/vpc"
  vpc_cidr  = "10.0.0.0/16"
  subnet_count = 3
}

source: Path to the module code.
Other arguments are input variables for customization.

Benefits:
Simplifies code: Reduces duplication.
Organizes infrastructure: Makes large projects easier to manage.
Enables sharing: Teams can share modules for common AWS setups.

In Terraform modules, the architecture typically includes three main files: main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf. 
Each serves a specific purpose to make the module reusable and organized.

1. main.tf
Purpose: Contains the core logic and resource definitions for the module.
Content: All the resources (like VPCs, EC2 instances, etc.) that the module manages.

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = var.vpc_cidr
  // ...other settings...
}

2. variables.tf

Purpose: Declares input variables for the module.
Content: All configurable parameters that users can pass to the module.

variable "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for the VPC"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

3. outputs.tf
Purpose: Defines output values that the module returns after execution.
Content: Useful information (like resource IDs, IP addresses) that other modules or root configuration can use.

output "vpc_id" {
  value = aws_vpc.main.id
}


AWS Route tables

An AWS route table is a set of rules (routes) that determines how network 
traffic is directed within your VPC.

Key Points:
Purpose: Controls how traffic moves between subnets, the internet, and other networks.
Association: Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table (either explicitly or by default).
Routes: Each route specifies a destination (CIDR block) and a target (like an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, or another subnet).
Default Route Table: Every VPC has a main route table used by default unless you associate a subnet with a custom route table.

Example:
A public subnet’s route table might have a route:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (all internet traffic)
Target: Internet Gateway (for public access)

A private subnet’s route table might have a route:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: NAT Gateway (for outbound internet access only)

Summary:
A route table in AWS defines how traffic is routed within your VPC, enabling control over 
connectivity between subnets, the internet, and other networks.
