To create a eks cluster we need 2 IAM roles:
1. EKS Cluster Role: This role is used by the EKS service to manage the cluster.
   It typically includes permissions for creating
   and managing resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups.


2. EKS Node Group Role: This role is used by the worker nodes in the EKS cluster. 
   It allows the nodes to interact with AWS services, such as pulling container images from ECR,
   writing logs to CloudWatch, and accessing other AWS resources.


IAM roles need to be created with the necessary policies attached.
The policies should include permissions for EKS operations, EC2 instance management,
VPC management, and any other AWS services that the EKS cluster will interact with.

Two separate polices need for the two roles:

1. EKS Cluster Role Policy: This policy should include permissions for EKS operations, 
   such as creating and managing clusters, managing VPCs, and handling security groups.
2. EKS Node Group Role Policy: This policy should include permissions for EC2 instance management, 
   ECR access, CloudWatch logging, and any other necessary AWS services that the worker nodes will
   need to interact with.
