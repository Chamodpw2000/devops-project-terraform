# This Terraform block attaches multiple IAM policies to the EKS node IAM role:

# policy_arn = each.value: The ARN of the policy being attached (e.g., worker node, CNI, and container 
# registry policies).
# role = aws_iam_role.node.name: The IAM role for EKS worker nodes that receives these permissions.
# Purpose: This ensures your EKS worker nodes have all the necessary permissions to join the cluster, 
# manage networking, and pull container images from Amazon ECR. Each policy provides a specific set of 
# permissions required for node operation in EKS.

# Hereâ€™s what each IAM policy does for EKS worker nodes:

# AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy

# Grants permissions for EC2 instances (worker nodes) to communicate with the EKS control plane.
# Allows nodes to join the cluster, register themselves, and report status.
# AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy

# Provides permissions for the Amazon VPC CNI plugin, which manages pod networking in EKS.
# Allows worker nodes to create, attach, and manage network interfaces for Kubernetes pods.
# AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly

# Allows worker nodes to pull container images from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
# Ensures nodes can download application images needed to run your workloads.
# Each policy is essential for proper operation of EKS worker nodes in your cluster.
