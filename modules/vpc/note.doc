VPC

An AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services 
cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

Key Features of a VPC:
Isolation: Your VPC is isolated from other AWS accounts and VPCs.
Customizable Network: You choose the IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, gateways, and security settings.
Subnets: Divide your VPC into public and private subnets for organizing resources and controlling access.
Security: Use security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic to resources.
Internet Connectivity: Attach an Internet Gateway to allow resources in public subnets to access the internet.
Private Connectivity: Use NAT Gateways, VPNs, or AWS Direct Connect for private communication.

Common Use Cases:
Hosting web applications with public and private subnets.
Running databases in private subnets for security.
Creating hybrid cloud architectures with VPN or Direct Connect.

Subnet

An AWS subnet is a segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place resources like EC2 instances.

Key Points:
Subdivision: A subnet divides the VPC’s IP address range into smaller blocks.
Location: Each subnet is mapped to a specific Availability Zone (AZ) in a region.

Types:
Public subnet: Can route traffic to/from the internet (usually via an Internet Gateway).
Private subnet: No direct internet access; used for internal resources (like databases).

Purpose:
Organize resources by function, security, or availability.
Control network access and routing.


Example:
If your VPC uses 10.0.0.0/16, you might create:

Public subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 in AZ1
Private subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 in AZ2

Internet Gateway

An Internet Gateway in AWS is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component 
that allows communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.

Key Points:
Purpose: Enables instances in public subnets to send and receive traffic to/from the internet.
Attachment: You attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC.
Routing: Public subnets use route tables that direct traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.
No Cost: There is no additional charge for using an Internet Gateway.
Use Case: Required for web servers, load balancers, or any resource that needs public internet access. 
Without an Internet Gateway, resources in your VPC cannot communicate directly with the internet.

You attach an Internet Gateway to a VPC, not to a subnet.

Explanation:

The Internet Gateway provides internet access for the entire VPC.
Subnets within the VPC can use the Internet Gateway for internet access if their route tables are configured to direct traffic to it.
You do not attach an Internet Gateway directly to a subnet.
Summary:
Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC, and subnets use it via routing.
