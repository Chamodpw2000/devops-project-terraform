# Declares a resource of type aws_s3_bucket and names it s3-bucket for 
# reference within Terraform.

# Sets the name of the S3 bucket to demo-terraform-eks-chamod-state-bucket-chamod.

# The lifecycle block controls how Terraform manages the resource.
# prevent_destroy = false means Terraform is allowed to destroy (delete) this bucket if you run terraform destroy or remove the resource from your configuration.
# If set to true, Terraform would refuse to destroy the bucket, protecting it from accidental deletion.
# This block creates an S3 bucket with a specific name and allows Terraform to delete it if needed. The lifecycle setting is useful for controlling resource protection.

# attribute { name = "LockID" type = "S" }:
# Defines the attribute LockID as a string (S). This is required because itâ€™s used as the hash key.
