There are 3 types of kubernetes services:
1. ClusterIP
2. NodePort
3. LoadBalancer

1. ClusterIP -  This is the default service type. It exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. 
   Pods can communicate with the service using this IP, but it is not accessible from outside the cluster.

So even in the same VPC for an instance that is outside the cluster, it cannot access the service. Only the node is able to access the service using the cluster-internal IP.
External Instance can access only the node IP.

2. NodePort - This service type exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). 
   A ClusterIP service, to which the NodePort service routes, is automatically created. 
   You can contact the NodePort service from outside the cluster by requesting <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
   When change the service type to NodePort, kubernetes allocates a port from a range (default: 30000-32767) and each node in the cluster will listen on that port.

In Kubernetes, when you create a NodePort service, Kubernetes automatically creates a ClusterIP service behind the scenes.

The ClusterIP service acts as the internal load balancer for your pods. It gets a stable internal IP address and routes traffic to the pods.
The NodePort service exposes that ClusterIP service on a static port on every node in your cluster, making it accessible from outside 
the cluster via <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
So, when you access the NodePort, your request first goes to the nodeâ€™s IP and port, then gets forwarded to the ClusterIP service, 
which finally routes it to the correct pod(s). This setup allows both internal and external access to your application.


3. LoadBalancer - This service type exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. 
   When you create a LoadBalancer service, Kubernetes will provision a load balancer for your service, and it will be assigned a public IP address.
   You can access the service using this public IP address.

   When changing the service type to LoadBalancer, Kubernetes will interact with the cloud provider's API to provision the load balancer.
   This process may take a few moments, and the service will remain in a pending state until the load balancer is ready.
   Once the load balancer is provisioned, it will be assigned a public IP address, which you can use to access the service from outside the cluster.
