Ingress -> incoming traffic

Kubernetes Ingress is a powerful resource that allows you to manage external access to your services in a Kubernetes cluster. 
It provides a way to define rules for routing HTTP(S) traffic to different services based on the request's host and path.

when we create a ingress resource, we define the rules for routing traffic in a YAML file. 
This file specifies the hostnames and paths to match, as well as the backend services to route the traffic to. 
Once the Ingress resource is created, the Ingress controller takes over and manages the traffic routing according to the defined rules.

Flow of Ingress:

1. Create a Ingress controller and configuration YAML file.

2. Ingress Controller reads the configuration from the Ingress resource and creates load balancer accordingly.
