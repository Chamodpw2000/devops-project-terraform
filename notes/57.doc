Ingress Controller should be deployed by us.

1. Need to identify which Ingress controller to use. (Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, etc)
(Load balancer companies also provide their own ingress controllers like AWS ALB Ingress controller)
2. Deploy the Ingress controller in the cluster.
3. Create a Ingress resource configuration YAML file for required service.

Then the Ingress controller is watching at the Ingress resource and will read the configuration from the Ingress resource and create load balancer accordingly.
