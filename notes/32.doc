Terraform Lifecycle Overview

Terraform init - Initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It sets up the backend, 
downloads provider plugins, and prepares the environment for further Terraform commands.

Terraform plan - Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to change the infrastructure
to match the desired state defined in the configuration files. This step allows you to review the changes before
they are applied.

Terraform apply - Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration. This step
provisions the infrastructure and can create, update, or delete resources as needed.

Terraform destroy - Destroys the infrastructure managed by Terraform, removing all resources defined in the
configuration files. This step is typically used for cleanup or when you no longer need the resources.
