Creating a Load Balancer.

1. Create a Service of type LoadBalancer.
2. This instruction taken by API server.
3. It passes this instruction to cloud control manager.
4. Cloud control manager creates a load balancer in the cloud provider.
5. Ip address of the load balancer is assigned to the previously created Load Balancer service.

Cons of Load Balancer

1. Less Declarative Approach - Only thing we mention in kubernetes files is that service type is LoadBalancer, if we make other changers
they have to do in cloud provider UI and can not keep track of those changers. 

2. Not cost effective

3. Lack of flexibility - This approach highly depends on the cloud control manager and only can use cloud providers load balancer, can not use
other Load Balancer like Nginx, HAProxy etc.

4. If cloud provider does not support CCM, this approach will not work.


Only pro of load balancer service type is that it is easy to set up and use, requiring minimal configuration.
